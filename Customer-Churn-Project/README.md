- **Gender & churn analysis**: churn rates by gender and email opt-in  
 
- **Spending trends**:
 
  - Years as Customer vs Total Spend  
 
  - Number of Purchases vs Total Spend  
 
**Key insights**: higher tenure and more purchases generally link to higher spend; email opt-in customers tend to churn less.
